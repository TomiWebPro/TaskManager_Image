# TaskManager_Image
Have you just bought a system with lots of cores, and ever wanted to put pixel art onto your task manager, here's your day!

Step (zero):
Identify if you know how to run and execute a Python file and a c file, and identify if you have enough cores/threads for this to be reasonable.

Step one:
Create an empty folder that contains the Python code

Step two:
Create pixel art (at your task manager's resolution) somewhere like https://www.pixilart.com/draw (or not if you don't want)

Step three:
Export the pixel art and put the image (or any other image of any resolution/color) under the Python file

Step four:
execute the Python file, there will be an output image for you to identify errors and whether you like it or not.

Step five:
If you like the outputted image, there is a printed output at the console that contains the info to put in the c file.
like this: 

int shouldRunList[] = {
        255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255,
        255, 0, 0, 0, 255, 0, 0, 255,
        255, 0, 255, 255, 255, 0, 255, 0,
        255, 0, 0, 0, 255, 0, 0, 255,
        255, 255, 255, 0, 255, 0, 255, 0,
        255, 0, 0, 0, 255, 0, 0, 255,
        255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255, 255,
};

Step six:
Open the c file using a compiler, if you are a newbie like me who has only used Python, use https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/ and get a 30-day trial because configuring the environment is too confusing (I'm not sponsored or anything) 30 days should be enough for you to just getting some fun & there's no need to credit card credentials or anything.

Step seven:
When it's ready, replace the int shouldRunList[] with your own code from Python output, and run to see the result in task manager! 

Reminder: 
Make sure the resolution you enter is the resolution of the image, output, and task manager, if that is not right, it could waste you a whole lot of time to find where you have done wrong and start again. 

For critics: 
GET OUTTA HERE! YOU ARE NOT WELCOMED HERE! I PUT THE DEMO PICS JUST TO SHOW THAT IT WORKS, STOP POINTING AT RANDOM PLACES SAYING THAT I'M FAKE! BEFORE YOU COME AND SCREAM LIKE A BABY, RUN MY DAMN CODE! I DON'T KNOW NOTHING ABOUT SUPPORT ON CERTAIN HARDWARE / VERSIONS OF WINDOWS (although it should work on at least Windows 10 and 11) but I make no promises. I DON'T CARE IF YOU SAY IT'S TOO JUNKY AND FIZZY CUZ UR NOT MY BOSS AND I AIN'T GETTING PAID, SHUT UP! 

My code is under Creative Common or whatever, you guys are free to use it, modify it, and repost it and stuff, just keep a note somewhere of the og guy -tomiwebpro and all it's fine. 
I am not responsible for any damage it might propose to the software and hardware of your system, use it under your responsibility.
